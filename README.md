# ContactList

This project is meant to create a personal Contact List.
You can add the contact name, phones, e-mails and whatsapp numbers.

## Required

This project requires an API running locally (for the moment) to store and retrieve contacts.
If you'd like, you can use [contact-list-api](https://github.com/wmerussi/contact-list-api), it's already build for this project.

## Development server

After downloading, run `npm install` to install all project dependencies. 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
